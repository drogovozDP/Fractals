# Fractals
Each file contains a particular fractal's realization.

### julia_set_optimized.py
You can move fractal via arrows on a keyboard (up, down, left, right) and zoom via `p` (plus) and `m` (minus) buttons.

### julia_set_optimized.py
You can move fractal via arrows on a keyboard (up, down, left, right) and zoom via `p` (plus) and `m` (minus) buttons.
Also you can change value of constant `C` in the equation via `z`, `x`, `a`, and `s`:
 - `z` - increase real value.
 - `x` - increase image value.
 - `a` - decrease real value.
 - `s` - decrease image value.

### mandelbrot.py
Zoom via `p` (plus) and `m` (minus) buttons.
